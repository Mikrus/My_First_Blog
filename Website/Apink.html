                    <p class="blogdate">February 22nd, 2022 by April Joseph</p>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p class="blogpar">Anime Matsuri is an <u><strong>annual anime convention</strong></u> that first began
                    in 2007.
                    John and Deniece Leigh started the convention in the Hilton Americas hotel and over the years it
                    gained popularity, <br>
                    allowing it to be held continuously at the George R. Brown Center in downtown Houston, TX.
                    They have had <strong>several</strong> foreign guests attend their anime convention and in recent
                    years,
                    <br>the overall attendance has been <em>well over</em> 25,000 people! Some of the <em>notable
                        guests</em> that have attended the convention are: <br><br>Vic Mignogna (American Voice Actor),
                    Johnny Yong Bosch (American Actor & Voice Actor), Morning Musume (Japanese girl group), Cristina Vee
                    (American Voice Actress), and Yua Mikami (Japanese AV Actress & idol).
                </p>
                <h1 class="bloghead">What Year Was The Best For Anime Matsuri?</h1>
                <p class="blogpar2">Out of all years, Anime Matsuri has hosted its anime convention, I would say that
                    2019 was their <strong><u><em>most notable and best year!</u></em></strong><br>
                    There were tons of things in 2019 to look forward to that you can find at the convention. Some
                    people like to go for the cosplay meet-ups, others like to go for the car reactor shows. There are
                    always panels, usually a maid cafe, and you could always look forward to Voice Actors. What
                    separated 2019's convention from the rest was the big names in one year along with the special
                    services.

                <h2 class="bloghead2">Who Were Those Special Guests?</h2>
                <p class="blogpar2">My <strong><em>favorite guest</em></strong> was Apink, a Korean idol girl group. I
                    had heard one or two songs before attending the convention concert, <br>but it wasn't until I saw
                    the group in person that I was taken aback by how amazing they were.
                    Apink has won many awards, including the <strong>Best Celebrity</strong> award for 2017 and the
                    <strong>Best Female Group</strong> award in 2018. It was the first time a Korean group as
                    <br>popular as Apink had attended the convention.

                    The next notable guest was Ladybaby, a Japanese Kawaii Metal Music group. <br>In their genre of
                    music, they are well known and their <em>former member</em>, Ladybeard had a hand in their success.
